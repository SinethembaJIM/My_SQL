Introduction of Structured Query Language(SQL)


  1. SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is like a special language for talking to databases. 
	2. It helps you ask questions and do things with data stored in these databases.
	3.  For example, you can use SQL to find out how much money a store made selling electronics or to calculate the average price of products in that category.
	4. SQL is important because it's used in many systems that store and manage data, like a company's client information. Each letter in SQL's name means something:

• S stands for Structured, meaning it has rules and structure.
• Q stands for Query, which means asking questions.
• L stands for Language, as it's a way of communicating with databases.

Knowing SQL is valuable for software engineers and others who work with data because it helps them understand and work with data effectively.
